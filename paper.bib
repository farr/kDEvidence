  abstract={This paper presents a complete description of Virgo, the
                  French-Italian gravitational wave detector. The
                  detector, built at Cascina, near Pisa (Italy), is a
                  very large Michelson interferometer, with 3 km-long
                  arms. In this paper, following a presentation of the
                  physics requirements, leading to the specifications
                  for the construction of the detector, a detailed
                  description of all its different elements is
                  given. These include civil engineering
                  infrastructures, a huge ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
                  chamber (about 6000 cubic metres), all of the
                  optical components, including high quality mirrors
                  and their seismic isolating suspensions, all of the
                  electronics required to control the interferometer
                  and for signal detection. The expected performances
                  of these different elements are given, leading to an
                  overall sensitivity curve as a function of the
                  incoming gravitational wave frequency. This
                  description represents the detector as built and
                  used in the first data-taking runs. Improvements in
                  different parts have been and continue to be
                  performed, leading to better sensitivities. These
                  will be detailed in a forthcoming paper.}
